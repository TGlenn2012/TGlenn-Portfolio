                                This project developed and implemented an IoT curriculum for high school enrichment programs using backward design and constructionist principles. Students learned electronics, programming, connectivity, and design through hands-on modules. The curriculum enabled students with little prior experience to successfully prototype IoT applications. Results show significant skill development and engagement.
